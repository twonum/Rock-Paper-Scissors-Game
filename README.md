# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI, SQLite for local data storage, and SQL Server for maintaining a leaderboard. The game offers an interactive user interface, where users can log in, play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, and view a leaderboard to track wins and losses.
